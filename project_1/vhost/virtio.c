/* virtio.c: STUDENT IMPLEMENTATION FILE for Project 1 (Part III).
 *
 * In Part II you invented a device protocol (MMIO registers). Here you implement
 * the one the whole world actually uses: a virtio split virtqueue, driven by a
 * REAL QEMU virtual machine, whose stock virtio_console driver talks to your
 * code with no guest-side changes at all.
 *
 * The provided backend (backend.c) speaks the vhost-user protocol to QEMU, maps
 * the guest's memory, sets up the rings, and calls you every time the guest
 * kicks the queue. Everything below the seam is yours: TWO functions.
 *
 * WHAT IS PROVIDED: virtq.h (the ring structures, the memory map, the log sink),
 * backend.c (all vhost-user plumbing), run-qemu.sh (boots the VM).
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * TASK (a): virtq_gpa_to_hva(), the hypervisor's address translation.
 * ============================================================================
 * You wrote this once already: vmm_gpa_to_host() in Part I. This is the same
 * contract against a real hypervisor's memory map, except now there can be
 * SEVERAL regions with GAPS between them (see `struct virtq_mem` in virtq.h).
 *
 * Return a host pointer for [gpa, gpa+len), or NULL unless the range lies
 * ENTIRELY inside ONE region. The guest picks these numbers, so reject:
 *   - a range that runs off the end of its region (no straddling two regions),
 *   - an address in a gap between regions, or outside all of them,
 *   - a gpa + len that overflows.
 * Get this wrong and the guest can make your hypervisor read (or crash on)
 * memory that is not its own.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * TASK (b): vlog_virtq_handle(), the virtqueue.
 * ============================================================================
 * For every chain the guest has made available:
 *
 *   1. Read the head index from the AVAIL ring:
 *          head = vq->avail->ring[vq->last_avail % vq->num]
 *      (First read vq->avail->idx to see how many are ready, and virtq_rmb()
 *      before you trust the ring contents.)
 *   2. Walk the DESCRIPTOR CHAIN from `head`. For each descriptor:
 *        - VRING_DESC_F_WRITE set  -> it is space for the DEVICE to write into.
 *          This queue is guest->host, so it carries no data: skip it.
 *        - VRING_DESC_F_INDIRECT set -> it is not data either! `d->addr` points
 *          at a TABLE of further descriptors in guest memory (`d->len` bytes of
 *          them, so d->len / sizeof(struct vring_desc) entries), which form
 *          their own chain starting at index 0. Translate the table and walk it.
 *          (Indirect tables do not nest.)
 *        - otherwise it is data: translate d->addr with
 *              virtq_gpa_to_hva(mem, d->addr, d->len)
 *          (CHECK FOR NULL) and append its bytes to the record.
 *        - follow d->next while VRING_DESC_F_NEXT is set.
 *      Concatenate the chain's bytes into one record, capped at VIRTQ_MAX_RECORD
 *      (never overflow your buffer).
 *   3. Emit it:  vlog_sink_emit(sink, bytes, len);
 *   4. COMPLETE the chain on the USED ring:
 *          vq->used->ring[vq->used->idx % vq->num] = { .id = head, .len = 0 };
 *          virtq_wmb();
 *          vq->used->idx++;
 *      (This is the virtio equivalent of the Part II STATUS/SEQ readback: it is
 *      how the driver learns its buffer is free again. Get it wrong and the
 *      guest hangs after a few writes.)
 *   5. Advance vq->last_avail and count the chain.
 *
 * Return the number of chains you completed; the backend raises the guest's
 * interrupt when that is > 0.
 *
 * SAFETY: the rings live in memory the GUEST owns and can change at any time. A
 * descriptor index, a chain, or a length can be nonsense. Bounds-check every
 * index against the table size, check every translation, and never loop forever
 * on a cyclic chain. A hypervisor must not be crashable by its guest.
 *
 * See SPEC.md Part III. Develop against `cd tests && ./run_virtq_tests.sh`, then
 * watch it drive a real VM with `cd vhost && ./run-qemu.sh`.
